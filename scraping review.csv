I bought these for basketball because it seems that no shoe manufacturer makes specifically wide widths in basketball shoes, much less any width that even comes close to fitting my Fred Flintstone feet. And running shoes don't provide the support I apparently need. I tried the ""wide"" basketball shoes recommended by various websites (LeBrons, TMacs, Dames, etc.) but it was like trying to put my 6-year-old's shoes on. To be fair, I haven't tried New Balance's bball shoes--they don't come in wide widths specifically, but NB tends to run wider overall. However, I could not bring myself to wear a shoe whose design looks like it was stolen from a billboard in the background of any random scene in Blade Runner.The Monarchs are comfortable with excellent cushioning. I normally wear a 4E in New Balance and Clarks, and a wide in Keens, and the width on these works very well for me, which is the most important feature for me. Overall, I find they're quite...padded, for lack of a better word--especially in the tongue and upper. So they might require a tiny bit of breaking in.My only complaint is that the insole is very thin and I'm not sure if it's intended to be removed. I did remove it to check, and I could tell that I was separating a layer of weak adhesive; the insoles came out perfectly intact, though, and I have since reinstalled them with no issues. I normally would wear a custom orthotic with these, but it seems like it might be a tight squeeze. I haven't tried that yet, as my orthotics are pretty rigid, and it's clear that being away from the court for 10 years has had an effect on my knees that the cushioning helps mitigate.And OK, yes: These are the quintessential dad shoes. There's no getting around that. But I'm a middle-aged dad who's not playing ball with a bunch of teenagers. I also don't really care that much what other people think of something that has absolutely nothing to do with them. So the math on that is fairly easy to do. Admittedly, though, I bought the all-black version and added a set of blue laces, which sort of (?) begins to maybe make them look slightly cooler. I'm very happy with my purchase, overall.

These shoes are the best all around shoe for the person that’s looking comfort without sacrificing style, goes with almost every pair of pants or shorts, great for a casual night out or a stroll around the neighborhood with your dog, totally a dad shoe 100% but dad shoes are sooo comfy
"

The first 2 times I got the shoes I loved the hella comfortable this time not to sure why but not so much and I’m down 35 lbs but I will still buy again wish they where cheaper

I have been buying this item for a long time. This pair is the same as what I have been buying from another place. Looking forward to wearing them.

Great for everyday use. Very  comfortable.

I haven't had the shoe 3 weeks. The right shoe has developed a squeak. My old pair of the same shoe squeak as well. It was about 8 months before they started squeaking. Other than that. They are comfortable & durable.

Great Shoes. I have been buying the air Monarch for quite a few years now . I work on concrete floors at a parts store. These are Great for the long hours and surprisingly very tough. I work around Battery acid,break fluid, motor oil Just all kinds of stuff and they hold up for a very long time. I still have my Old pair from 4 years ago, and still wear them here at the house.
"
"
The last pair I had almost a year and there was barely ware on the soles, but the toe box separated from the sole of the shoe. I hesitated about buy this pair. If this proves to be the same low quality, it will be my last pair.
"
"
I love these shoes that's why I've bought the over and over again....
"
"
Supportive and comfortable shoe at an affordable price.
"
"
Just what I ordered
"
"
This was my daily wear until the sole started to separate from the shoe after a year.
"
"
This is my go-to gym shoe. It is comfortable and I can buy it knowing that it will fit as I want it to.

I like the arch support but I don’t like that it’s hard to put  because the opening is too tight.
"
"
Quality and value
"
"
The shoes appear to be new and good,  but the box was damaged with a hole through  the top and a rubber band around it holding it together. Not a good look for the price and supposedly new Nikes
"

I worked for Nike from 1987-92 and got 4-5 free pair a month. So I’ve worn a great deal of Nike sneakers. The last few years they’ve become too tight to wear. My son got these and I loved the look so ordered them.Sliding them on is a bitch, once I get them on my feet get sore and I need to slide them off. It’s my fault for not returning them asap. I figured they’d stretch enough to be comfortable.

After reading a lot, I bought my first pair of these shoes because I HAD heel spurs, and I wrote I HAD (all capital letters) because without medicines, doctor’s visit and/or any surgery, the heel spurs is totally gone.I have 4 pairs of these in different colors, my feet are completely healed and I’m super happy to given them a chance.

"
These shoes are great for me to where for everyday use at work or play!  I have an issue with my ankle rolling at times do to surgery and these help as far as comfort and no pain when putting pressure on that foot.  Weight is evenly distributed with out effort.
"
"
Loved these have been searching for these shoes in my wife's size for over a year and finally found them!!!!!!
"
"
purchased for 16 year old son - one of the shoes popped after a couple months
"
"
Love the color combination and this model in general! I have different colors of same shoe! Always a pleasant surprise!
"
"
My grandson wanted them, he loved them!! It’s a nice looking shoe!!
"
"
For my Birthday.
"
"
As expected
"

Stain on the bottom of right shoe. I ordered the 2017 air max and came with dents in one. Is it worth taking back ? Can’t find my size else where so I guess not

"

Fit just as expected and are very comfortable. Bought 2 other pairs in different colors. Color is a bit of egg/tinted white but I like them a lot
"
"
I've been asked several times what cologne I have on. It has a fresh smell and doesn't take much also last me all all day or all night.
"
"
I was so happy when I in packaged these shoes. They look very nice and I love the all black look for the days I need extra comfortable shoes as as a retail manager. The only problem is the right shoe makes a very loud, terrible popping/squeaking noise with EVERY SING STEP.😩 So this pair is going to be returned and I will purchase from my local shoe store to test for this unexpected and bazaar issue. LOVE AMAZON THOUGH!!!
"
"
This is the second pair of  Nike Revolution running shoes I have worn and they are great for walking and wearing all day at work. I do a lot of walking as a field service tech and these shoes offer great support. Much less foot fatigue than I have had in the past. Highly recommended!
"
"
Shoes fit perfectly. Surprisingly lightweight. I have very wide feet, and I was concerned about the shoes being too tight. Overall, great pair sneakers for running or just walking.
"
"
The shoe itself was fine, but the merchant shipped the wrong size and I had issues with customer service. Would recommend buying elsewhere.
"
"
Comfortable and light but... Had them for a few months now and it never really bothered me because I was wearing them mostly outside but they squeak on absolutely every surface. Very embarrassing and disturbing when you're walking through an almost silent ICU just something I thought people should know.
"

Bonitos y livianos, le gustaron mucho a mi esposo.

I order a size 10.5 in these shoes, and I love these shoes. However, the shoes I ordered did not fit; they fit like a 10.  I submitted for a return, and after delivering the shoes back to UPS, I received a partial refund.  Of the $79 that I spent on shipping, taxes, and the shoes, I am being charged a re-stocking fee and losing $23, with no explanation.  This is not fair, and this doesn't seem right; I will be reaching out to my credit card company to dispute this.  I sent multiple emails to the store for help, but they never responded.

En la publicación deberían indicar el tipo de orma del calzado ya que no los quería extra Wide ya que son muy anchos. Pregunten antes de comprar. No quedé satisfecho

Fit just as expected and are very comfortable. Bought 2 other pairs in different colors. Color is a bit of egg/tinted white but I like them a lot
"

I've been asked several times what cologne I have on. It has a fresh smell and doesn't take much also last me all all day or all night.

I was so happy when I in packaged these shoes. They look very nice and I love the all black look for the days I need extra comfortable shoes as as a retail manager. The only problem is the right shoe makes a very loud, terrible popping/squeaking noise with EVERY SING STEP.😩 So this pair is going to be returned and I will purchase from my local shoe store to test for this unexpected and bazaar issue. LOVE AMAZON THOUGH!!!

This is the second pair of  Nike Revolution running shoes I have worn and they are great for walking and wearing all day at work. I do a lot of walking as a field service tech and these shoes offer great support. Much less foot fatigue than I have had in the past. Highly recommended!
"
"
Shoes fit perfectly. Surprisingly lightweight. I have very wide feet, and I was concerned about the shoes being too tight. Overall, great pair sneakers for running or just walking.
"
"
The shoe itself was fine, but the merchant shipped the wrong size and I had issues with customer service. Would recommend buying elsewhere.
"
"
Comfortable and light but... Had them for a few months now and it never really bothered me because I was wearing them mostly outside but they squeak on absolutely every surface. Very embarrassing and disturbing when you're walking through an almost silent ICU just something I thought people should know.

Bonitos y livianos, le gustaron mucho a mi esposo.

I order a size 10.5 in these shoes, and I love these shoes. However, the shoes I ordered did not fit; they fit like a 10.  I submitted for a return, and after delivering the shoes back to UPS, I received a partial refund.  Of the $79 that I spent on shipping, taxes, and the shoes, I am being charged a re-stocking fee and losing $23, with no explanation.  This is not fair, and this doesn't seem right; I will be reaching out to my credit card company to dispute this.  I sent multiple emails to the store for help, but they never responded.

I really wanted to get a different Nike shoe.  However, I was pleased with this purchase.  They are comfortable, although I would of preferred more cushion in the inside of the shoe.  A personal preference of course.  I would certainly recommend getting these.  I wear a size 10 and a half but I got a larger size.  11 and a half.  I have a wide foot, so the larger size fits better for me.
"
"
I like the shoe. Fits great, true to size, and feels good wearing all day. But these are the worst laces ever. They always come undone and they're way too long. So, I'm always stepping on them. Even if I were to double knot them. Maybe replace the laces and you have a fine shoe.
"
"
They looked a bit clunky when I first wore them but now I have them broken in and they feel good doing squats and light runs.
"
"
I liked how fast they were shipped. The overall look is fantastic. The fit is great

I’ve been using this for about a month now for light workouts and regular wear and it’s been holding up good. I settled on this after a couple of others and this has been the best of the lot. This shoe is what I was looking for!
"
"
These are good for work shoes if you walk a lot. Not heavy lifting shoes but good for your feet. I wear them everyday and they have held up well.

Feels tight , uncomfortable
"

Not enough cushion
"

I wear these every day in auto shop. They last about 3 months. Never hurting my knees or weird muscle cramps.
"
"
Not as cushioned / comfortable as I expected for a training shoe. I'm not a big fan of Nike shoes, but I had the TR2 predecessor shoe which I was happy with. Less so for the TR4 model.
"
"
These shoes fit good but you have to pay attention to the sizing chart whether they are regular or wide. Overall good durable shoe with great comfort for every day where
"
"
Durability not great.
"

Got it for indoor and tennis reasons, and so far, it's a great experience. I will update the review if I see any problems when I regularly use it.Tried for airport walks as well and happy with the performance.
"
"
Quite comfortable but not for a long walk
"
"
Caused bruises on toe next to big toe on both feet. Needed 13 and 1/2 sizes
"
"
I loved these so much that I went to order another pair but they were sold out. Glad I got them while I could!

I got these for my bf instead of af1s because the style he wants are impossible to find rn. He’s had these before but these were strangely too big even though I got his size, and they don’t feel as comfortable as the other ones he’s had in the past. Still nice for the price and came in the mail in less than 24 hours
"

Nice shoes... i use them as casual...fits as expected.. I'm 13 on Nike.. on other brands I always buy bigger. But Nike always fits good
"
"
It's a bit tight I suppose you can't hike with them or walk far I love the style tho and you can workout in them so not bad I like + price not over rated like the air max or Jordan like bro 500$ shoes not gonna last forever lower it.

Dislike they came in bag not actually a Nike box.

They appear to be authentic Nikes but they don't have the cushion and sturdy feeling like all my other Nikes. Must be irregulars but got what I paid for.

These are great running shoes. They have really helped my plantar fasciitis along with some good insoles. They are a little bit shallow though. What I mean by that is that they hit really low on my heel and my heel slides out a little bit when I’m running. I don’t love that part but otherwise I like the shoes.
"
"
Not sure about the reason, I use other Nike shoes models without problems but this one, even the same numebr size, it felt smaller for me, like narrower. The orange pipe is really fluo.
"
"
Absolutely love these shoes. They're just my everyday/walking shoes so I can't speak to the durability or performance of long term running but for what I use them for, they're amazing. Love the style and they're extremely comfortable to wear.
"
"
As I just received the shoes today I already love them! They are by far the most comfortable Nike shoe I have ever worn. I run a lot and I can tell this shoe is perfect for that. I have skinny feet and these were very form fitting. It is also a tight shoe and in my opinion a tight shoe makes for a good running shoe. So in conclusion the shoe is very comfortable and a great running shoe!
"
"
Only running shoe I used for over 20 yrs and counting I just wished they would last longer but it don't matter when u have like 6 pairs
"
"
The shoes are lightweight!However, they feel tight in the first week or so. After the first week, you'll start feeling it stretching out.I'll wait a couple of weeks to give it a 5 from 4 currently.

Very comfortable, walk a lot of miles each week. These sneakers provide support and comfort for my feet.

Styling, quality of materials, fit and comfort all perfect. One small design fault the tongue under the laces is too short/thin  so the  final loop of laces feels like it is digging in a little. That apart one happy customer.

Shoes arrived a day early, and in perfect condition. The top of the original box was missing, but that box was packaged inside a bigger, sturdier cardboard box for shipping, and it did its job in keeping the shoes from being compromised in any way. I noticed a whole horde of comments are condemning the seller for sending a slightly damaged original box and I find this SO ridiculous. Those orange Nike logo boxes are flimsy from the start, and aren’t made for shipping - only for in-store handling.  This is a great product from a reputable seller - give these a try!
"

These are great quality and value for the money.

Good looking shoes and seems durable and it really stops right there. The 3 out of 5 mainly from the comfort. The first 2 weeks, I was miserable wearing them and even avoided wearing them due to pain in the toe area(bend point). The material the shoe is made of is very thick, step down from motor boots.
"

Always on the lookout for a shoe that looks like the ones Kyle Reese wore in Terminator. This are close but they do not look as good on as they do pictured.  They also make noise when you walk.

Bought 5hese for my husband. He likes them, says they are very comfortable.
"
"
12/10 would buy again
"
"
Fit is pretty good, came clean. Shoes a little more klunky and stiffer than I would imagine but otherwise very satisfied
"
"
Gran compra, gran calidad del producto
"
"
Still a decent looking shoe but need a wider body
"
"
Excellent purchase
"
"
Sent a UK11 not US11. All good
"
"
Great shoe, I was slightly surprised because of some of the negative reviews but exceeded my expectations.
"
"
The upper part of the shoe is all leather so it makes the good looks last
"
"
A mi esposo le gustaron mucho,  se los compre de regalo de cumpleaños,  y se ven muy bonitos
"

My boyfriend wears these very often and they still look new! I ordered his normal size and they fit perfect, but when I bought white ones for myself I had to return and re-buy twice because I couldn’t figure out the right size, I had to go up half a size for these to fit me

Shoes arrived a day early, and in perfect condition. The top of the original box was missing, but that box was packaged inside a bigger, sturdier cardboard box for shipping, and it did its job in keeping the shoes from being compromised in any way. I noticed a whole horde of comments are condemning the seller for sending a slightly damaged original box and I find this SO ridiculous. Those orange Nike logo boxes are flimsy from the start, and aren’t made for shipping - only for in-store handling.  This is a great product from a reputable seller - give these a try!
"
"
These are great quality and value for the money.

For my grandson for school

Beautiful shoe

Good looking shoes and seems durable and it really stops right there. The 3 out of 5 mainly from the comfort. The first 2 weeks, I was miserable wearing them and even avoided wearing them due to pain in the toe area(bend point). The material the shoe is made of is very thick, step down from motor boots.

I bought these Nikes because I thought they were very nice looking but an added bonus was when I discovered how comfortable they were! I am getting the other colors next. I get so many compliments from strangers when I wear them. I got the dark blue and they really look nice with jeans or shorts. The seller was very quick to ship them and I had no problems whatsoever. Love my shoes!!
"

The shoe had an abnormally long tongue. I wasn’t a huge fan of it. Looks kinda weird with shorts.
"

Good

Best shoe ever love the throw back to the 70's look

The sneaker is wonderful  🙌🏽

11.5 has a snug fit. I have the same pair in black that I purchased from Nike last year, 11.5 was a perfect fit. You may want to order a size up.

These remind me of the very first pair of Nikes that I got back in 1981 (the ones that I had to beg my mother to pay $35 for). I wouldn't use these for actual running as they seem more for fashion than anything else, but I'm okay with that. I did wear them on a trip to an amusement park, and they felt fine after walking all day - no blisters or problems. I only wish that the other colors were available. Other than that, I'm happy I found these.
"
"
Great classic sneaker.
"
"
Shoe quality was great, but as far as to the tongue and size they are a bit big. Recommend getting a half size smaller ..
"
"
Not often I order shoes online but  satisfied with product & company. Arrived early and I appreciate the photo delivery email sent to me. Very happy
"
"
very comfortable shoe. light weight and stylish (at least in my opinion).
"
"
Fit my husband PERFECTLY! He loves them!
"
"
try to find another pair of basic running shoes.  they dont exist.  everything looks stupid, stupid colors, stupid designs, modern, ridiculous looking.  These are stylish, simple and classic.  No frills, no bs.  Just a regular damn shoe which apparently is nearly impossible to find anymore
"
"
Si me agrado..
"
"
These shoes are very cheaply made and I would find it hard to believe that they are actual Nike's.  The tongue is unfinished and you can see the foam around the edge.  They don't have the signature Nike tag on tongue-which is a dead give away.  A $70 mistake indeed.
"
"
I only use for walking, not any training. Wore them to a ""Fair"" and after about 4 hours had to take them off to let my feet relax and cool down. This was the first time I wore them, and purposely, to break them in, and see how comfortable they were to walk and wear all day.  I don't wear these every day, just on special occasions. I do feel confident on wearing them again for a day if needed.

I purchased these sneakers for walking. I weigh 240lbs and have had 4 knee surgeries.I used these sneakers last night for my walk. They fit as sized, they are comfortable. The cushioning is NOT like Air Max but I'll see how the cushioning is with changing out the insoles.Great price would buy them again.

Gracias  encantado  😊
"

when you look back at your amazon order they showed a different color and size than I ordered, but they arrived the correct size/color combo.My son liked them for gym class.  Comfortable.
"

Runs a little too small towards the tow area
"
"
These are comfortable & fit as expected.

The sneakers look cute. They arrived on time. I will buy more.
"

Very good

Didn’t realize grandson had grown 🤷🏼‍♀️ Needed size 13

ya su calidad no es la misma... tengo algunos pares con tres años y aun estan en servicio... pero ya he comprado 6 pares desde entonces y solo duran un año.....como ahora todo es chino....

Was Hesitant because i do have wide feet. Perfect fit. Also i did go a half size up reading reviews and i couldn't agree more
"
"
Works well on treadmill, elliptical, walking and court sports!
"
"
I did not like the fact that I wanted and thought I was getting the black & white product instead I got black & blue van product.  I would like to exchange for a size 11.5.
"
"
They looked liked the photo and are confortable
"
"
Brought these for my son. He is all about a comfortable shoe. And he loves these for school.
"
"
Grandson loves them
"
"
I'm a twelve with other sizes but I always use a 13 for Nike. I did that and the shoe fit just fine, it is comfortable and came as seen
"
"
I wear these shoes for every day running around and I love them. I got a half size larger as Nike tend to run narrower and the results were a nice fitting comfortable pair of shoes.
"
"
Quite good shoes for everyday.
"
"
I ordered the all black shoes as you see it is advertising in the picture. I ended up getting the shoes in the picture I posted. Thankfully my boyfriend didn't mind and actually liked them to but if not what a pain that would be.

Shoes came quickly. Was exactly what I was looking for. Can't find good nikes anywhere in store anymore so I'm happy with them
"
"
I ordered .5 size larger than usual because people said it ran slightly small. These are too big and now I have to return them. Just get your normal size and save the headache. If they are a little snug they will break in anyways.
"
"
Great product - everything as promised
"
"
Comfort light weight
"
"
These are great shoes.  The prior pair (size 6) was getting too small for my son (11Y) and he liked them so much that he wanted the exact same style.  In particular, the soles and toe caps are fairly flexible if you do not like a firm/hard sneaker.  We ended up getting a size 8 (which probably begs the question how he fits into the size 6 without having to scrunch his toes?!?).One thing I also noticed is that the size 8 shoes do not have the loop on the back to provide assistance with pulling on the shoe.  I wasn't sure if this was a feature they removed from the latest iteration of the shoe.  Or maybe this feature only exists on sub-7 'youth' sizes and does not exist in 'adult' sizes?  I wish it was still there, but I guess Nike was able to cut costs by removing the little loop.
"
"
Good deal for sure
"
"
They are as comfortable as I expected; however, the sneakers do not have a traditional tongue as one would expect.  The tongueless design makes them a little harder to get on if you like them tied tight as I do.
"
"
Shoes fit and look great, but the downside is that every single rock gets stuck at the bottom of the crevices in the sole of the shoe, and I find myself constantly having to pick rocks off every time I go inside my house :( Poor design of the bottom side of the sole.Happenes to all 3 pairs of Nike Free Runs I bought.
"
"
I initially got a size 9.5 because that is what fit with previous models of the Free Run shoe.  This new model added leather material to the toe for extra support so, I had to up size to a 10 and they now fit perfect!
"
"
I love these shoes, they run a little small so with return my 10s for 10.5. The reviews are right about that. No biggie, buying 3 colorways! Glad these came back!!!!!

The shoe looks good and seems well made. My son wears 10.5 and has wide feet so these were too narrow for him and had to be sent back. I should've bought a 10.5W had I known how tight they'd be on his foot. Otherwise, it's a very lightweight shoe with the right hints of color.
"
"
The fit on the shoe is definitely snug. I wear a 10.5, and probably should've  ordered an 11. Doesn't bother me enough to return it, but men should probably order half a size up, especially if you have wider feet.
"
"
Light weight & As always: very well made.
"
"
We tried a few brands of running shoes and this one always comes up on top.  It's light weight, fits great, and to size, and is rather durable.  The number of miles we can get out of this shoe is impressive.  Will continue to purchase
"
"
I have been wearing nothing but Frees since they were introduced. There have been many variations over the years. This version is the best so far. And the design goes back close to the original. No tounge. Forget about that weird paper thin heel piece (junk). This version is great. I have several pairs horded in my closet, and will buy more.When Nike quits making this shoe. I will quit buying Nikes. That's all I got.
"
"
Love this shoe. Super comfortable, light and snug. I have an older pair and repurchased because of it was such a great shoe.
"
"
I was scared to order shoes like this online but I am so happy with these!! Foot pain going away from incorrect soles of other shoes
"
"
This is a very comfortable and very stylish shoe. Fits very well and is my favorite shoe to run in. Almost like rubbing barefoot which I love. If you walk a lot or run a lot these are perfect.
"
"
Nice shoes, nicely made, but an 8.5 mens fits like a 9 womens.
"

"

Very light weight shoes it took a minute to use to the arch of the shoe so far they very comfortable. You can wear them with pants or with shorts either way they look good
"
"
There's nothing to dislike with this shoe.  It fits impeccably.  It gives me the proper support, is extremely comfortable and works with just about every terrain I have been in.  Due to the nice looks of these shoes, I tend to wear them mostly in mild settings where not much damage will be incurred on them, but, they grip to the earth well, and are not prone to slipping anywhere.  This is an A+++ shoe.

My grandson was happy with the shoes.
"
"
Wanted a decent pair of mid-top Nikes that weren't a bazillion bright colors or priced like gold. Couldn't find anything in my town of 70,000 people, found these here and they fit like a glove. I usually wear 9-9.5, went 9.5 and it was spot on. Couldn't be happier.
"
"
Fit perfect very comfortable
"
"
Hubby is hard on his shoes but these last. He gets new pair every 6 months or so just for cosmetic look. Fit stays like new though
"
"
They are still holding up, nice shoes
"
"
Supports my feet as I drive a tractor trailer & jump in & out all day. They make my feet feel good & make it easy to clean my tractor out at the end of my shift.

There's nothing to dislike with this shoe.  It fits impeccably.  It gives me the proper support, is extremely comfortable and works with just about every terrain I have been in.  Due to the nice looks of these shoes, I tend to wear them mostly in mild settings where not much damage will be incurred on them, but, they grip to the earth well, and are not prone to slipping anywhere.  This is an A+++ shoe.

Working out shoe. Absolutely No Complaints!!
"
"
Nice comfortable fit  Will definitely order again
"

Loved the order will be ordering again soon. Highly recommended

My grandson was happy with the shoes.

Wanted a decent pair of mid-top Nikes that weren't a bazillion bright colors or priced like gold. Couldn't find anything in my town of 70,000 people, found these here and they fit like a glove. I usually wear 9-9.5, went 9.5 and it was spot on. Couldn't be happier.
"
"
Fit perfect very comfortable

Hubby is hard on his shoes but these last. He gets new pair every 6 months or so just for cosmetic look. Fit stays like new though
"
"
They are still holding up, nice shoes
"

Supports my feet as I drive a tractor trailer & jump in & out all day. They make my feet feel good & make it easy to clean my tractor out at the end of my shift.
"
"
My husband bought them to work in. He does a lot of walking. These provide the comfort and durability he was looking for.
"
"
It was a birthday gift for my Father & he absolutely love it. He thought it was gonna be a bit small but it fit perfectly. This was a great find. Thanks Amazon.

Overall fit is perfect.  I’ve actually ordered a second pair to put on the shelf.
"
"
Need for husband he stands on his feet 10-12 hrs a day so he needed really good support
"
"
I have a very large foot size and this is the only shoe that I’ve ever worn that has accurately fit my feet and also not giving me back pain and help me with my deliveries
"
"
The shoes are good quality and just what I expected.
"

Worth the money 💰

I love the TORCH 4. Only NIKI shoe that fits my feet. Can’t find them anywhere so I bought the TORCH 3. Good as well.
"
"
These are great! I always wore Nike Shox NZ’s and these feel very similar to those. My feet are rejoicing!
"
"
Look great,fits good and my son loves them
"
"
The sneakers are great, the shipping was not,  came a week late and the box was only the original,  ripped open and had a rubber band holding it closed.
"
"
Very comfortable, good material.
"
"
Fit OK not what I expected
"
"
It resembles a soccer cleat.  Looks great from the side but the top lace width is super wide.
"
"
This is my second pair. Still wearing my first pair, and after four years of heavy use in the gym, boxing and everyday they look like new. Almost no signs of wear, except for the sole and inner lining. Very comfortable and look great.
"

Nice comfortable shoes

I normally don’t write reviews but I had to with this purchase. Calling all overly analytical people or hesitant online shoppers! Hopefully this review helps you whether you are buying these for yourself or as a gift.I got the black version. The sneaker quality is fantastic. It’s not flimsy but it is comfortable and very lightweight. Silver trim is made of perfect. I’m a 10.5 in tennis/athletic sneakers. These fit like a sneakers - not to narrow and length-wise they run larger size if you want. From heel to the tip of my big toe is about 10.5 inches long for reference. So if you know your Adidas or Puma or similar athletic shoe size, I would go down either a half size or a full size.

These are BY FAR the best sneakers for my PICKLEBALL game.  Super lightweight with good support.  I’ve tried them all from Kswiss to Nike.  These also breathe and are possibly the most comfortable shoes I’ve put on my feet except for my Ugg slippers!  Get these for tennis or pickle ball you will not be disappointed
"
"
I ordered a size 12. They sent me an 11.5. I ordered another 12 figuring it was a mistake, they sent me another 11.5. Shoes are fine but it helps if they actually fit and are the size ordered.
"
"
I'll keep things short.- Way too bouncy to be a running shoe. Yeah I know, Kipchoge wears them. I don't have his technique and neither does anyone reading this. You will f up your knees doing long distance with these.- Weak frame / poor lateral stability make it a no go for moderately technical trail running- They're comfy enough for commuting, which is what I'll end up using them for. 1 star for the kink in the back, which prevents my longer jeans from touching the ground.

OMG, these triple red Air Force 1s are beautiful!! They arrived as expected, look BETTER than expected, and fit great. I've been looking for some all red shoes to match all of my Bulls gear. I had no idea that these existed! I love them because they are bright red and not dull. I will be rockin' these very soon!
"
"
They are cool, easy to wash
"
"
Fit great!! Super comfy!! True to size.
"
"
The triple red are hard to come by and usually seasonal so I just purchased a second pair!
"
"
Just like the picture and true too size
"
"
I really like the shoes alot, what I like most about them is even though they are the white on whites, they have a suede back which makes them custom.  However they were a little pricey at $152 plus tax which brought it aboutm $172 before my gift card was added which brought them down to $80 and some change so I didn't feel it in my wallet too bad.

My son loved them!

Nothing to complain about

Most comfortable daily sneakers ever had. I actually had sciatica nerve damage until i started to buy air forces. Only my 5th pair. They stay in great condition for first good 6 months the way i wear them. And i wear them often. 10/10 shoes comfort for me

El diseño es bonito, las zapatillas pesan poco y son cómodas. Sin embargo, el precio es demasiado elevado. Te recomendaría su compra cuando estén en oferta y puedas comprarlas por unos 60 euros, que es un precio más que justo para lo que ofrecen.Como dato curioso, he de decir que al poco tiempo la zapatilla derecha comenzó a hacer un ruido extraño al pisar ciertas superficies. El ruido duró un par de meses y desapareció sin más; desconozco si volverá. Otros clientes se han quejado de dicho problema en la web oficial de Nike, por lo que parece tratarse de un defecto extendido. Además, si vas a usarlas en tierra, debes saber que se ensucian con mucha facilidad.Algunas personas se quejan de la talla. En mi caso, no hubo problema en ese sentido: pedí una 42, que es la que suelo calzar, y las zapatillas me están perfectas.Si la reseña te ha ayudado a aclararte las ideas, dale un buen like :D

Très bien pour un entraînement sur le dur. Pas les plus légères ni les plus dynamiques. Bon amorti, bonne solidité.
"
"
Muy cómodas para andar o correr

Very nice trainers with great cushion.  But too narrow for anyone with wide feet.
"
"
Molto comode, forse calzano un po' più strette
"
"
Die Schuhe sind schon gut aber man muss auch bedenken das sind keine Sommer Schuhe. Kann sein das es nur bei dem paar hier ist aber der Schuh ist so gut wie gar nicht atmungsaktiv, lässt Wärme und Gerüche raus aber so gut wie keine Luft wieder rein.Hab die Schuhe verschenkt nach nur einmal tragen, weil mir persönlich ist 42 zuuuuuu klein, mein Fuß ist 42 und jeden Nike den ich besitze ist auch 42. Diesen Laufschuh muss man sich auf jeden Fall ne Größe, größer holen.

Excellent to run. Excellent fit
"
"
The insoles have adequate padding to make your walk or run comfortable. Arch support and design is very good. Highly recommend.
"

Couldn’t beat the deal. Bought them for my husband and he really likes them. Very comfortable

These are the best shoes I've ever worn for working out. I've been looking for a comfortable walking/running shoe that provides great support and this shoe is ideal! I'm gonna get a pair for my husband.

Overall thois is a very nice comfortable sneaker
"
"
Very comfortable shoes. Makes running more enjoyable.
"
"
Very cushioned ride. Just what I was looking for.
"
"
The shoes arrived and looked great, only problem is that they were way too tight on my feet, and they were the same size as all Nike shoes I buy. Had to send back but the return was easy.
"

Tal cual los pedí, se sienten cómodos al caminar. La medida es tal cual, quizás un poco exactos sobre todo en la parte delantera porque son puntudos.
"
"
Excellent to run. Excellent fit

El artículo presentó defectos de fabricación, pero son minuciosos, el producto es original
"

Good looking, they keep your feet warm and dry, they feel like good quality. Worth the price.
"

I thought they were different

El diseño es bonito, las zapatillas pesan poco y son cómodas. Sin embargo, el precio es demasiado elevado. Te recomendaría su compra cuando estén en oferta y puedas comprarlas por unos 60 euros, que es un precio más que justo para lo que ofrecen.Como dato curioso, he de decir que al poco tiempo la zapatilla derecha comenzó a hacer un ruido extraño al pisar ciertas superficies. El ruido duró un par de meses y desapareció sin más; desconozco si volverá. Otros clientes se han quejado de dicho problema en la web oficial de Nike, por lo que parece tratarse de un defecto extendido. Además, si vas a usarlas en tierra, debes saber que se ensucian con mucha facilidad.Algunas personas se quejan de la talla. En mi caso, no hubo problema en ese sentido: pedí una 42, que es la que suelo calzar, y las zapatillas me están perfectas.Si la reseña te ha ayudado a aclararte las ideas, dale un buen like :D

Très bien pour un entraînement sur le dur. Pas les plus légères ni les plus dynamiques. Bon amorti, bonne solidité.
"
"
Muy cómodas para andar o correr
"

Very nice trainers with great cushion.  But too narrow for anyone with wide feet.
"
"
Molto comode, forse calzano un po' più strette
"
"
Die Schuhe sind schon gut aber man muss auch bedenken das sind keine Sommer Schuhe. Kann sein das es nur bei dem paar hier ist aber der Schuh ist so gut wie gar nicht atmungsaktiv, lässt Wärme und Gerüche raus aber so gut wie keine Luft wieder rein.Hab die Schuhe verschenkt nach nur einmal tragen, weil mir persönlich ist 42 zuuuuuu klein, mein Fuß ist 42 und jeden Nike den ich besitze ist auch 42. Diesen Laufschuh muss man sich auf jeden Fall ne Größe, größer holen.
"
"
I use these as a comfortable office shoe to change into after I wear my nicer shoes for coming/going/meetings/etc.  They are light and fit well, but have white and porous soles, so not good for outside/wet conditions unless you don't mind getting them dirty immediately.
"
"
My son loves this shoes so much. He is 16 and gets size 10.5. Perfect for running and gym.
"
"
These are my favorite running shoes since they came out. Now is very hard to find them even at Nike.
"
"
Perfect fit and feels nice. Love them and got them at better price than stores
"
"
Me encantaron, muy cómodos, la talla perfecta y a muy buen precio.
"
"
like the fit, price was very good for this shoe
"
"
The left shoe fits me true to size but the right is a little small in the toe area,still a great shoe.Very lightweight and comfortable just get 1/2 size larger
"
"
Excellent sneakers! But the sole could be better in terms of stones getting stuck in the holes.
"
"
These are great for everyday or simple distance running, but they weren’t great for sprints or any other quick-paced track and field events. Turning with these can be tricky as the ankle suppose just isn’t there. My husband had to slow is pace when he almost rolled his ankle. They’re great for everyday or simple distance just not athletic event where time is a factor.
"
"
Unbelievably comfortable!!! Love this shoe !!

Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!I haven't been able to find my old Nike Flyknit shoes here on Amazon and have been on the hunt for fashionable, functional and light weight tennis/running shoes.  When I go cheaper, I'm nearly always disappointed.  After a lot of searching I landed on these.  As is usually the case, some of the colors I want are out of stock in my size so I got the black/white combination, which is really more gray ... what I was looking for.They are very light, almost a mesh material and fit perfectly.  Looks-wise, they were very close to what I was looking for and I'm really pleased with how light they are and how well they fit.  I'm not a runner (bad knees) but wanted something versatile to where for walking or just casually going out.  Some have reported rocks getting stuck in the tread holes but I haven't had that issue myself.Hearing that Nike is pulling out of Amazon, I'm inclined to purchase another set of these shoes but figured other resellers would sell through Amazon.  Regardless, really happy with the look and functionality of these shoes.  Exactly what I was looking for.  A bit on the more expensive side but I've learned I have to get north of $100 to get the shoes that fit my desires.Would definitely purchase these again!

Power walking

These shoes are absolutely fantastic. Lightweight, breathable, supportive, responsive — they literally embody all the best qualities one could hope for in a sneaker. I’ve been wearing them for over a year now as go-to running shoes and also as my daily sneakers, and they have held up wonderfully. If they ever do break down, I will happily buy the same model in a heartbeat. Other Nikes don’t come close. I hope they never stop making these, because I will gladly buy this model for many years to come.
"
"
All is good
"
"
Perfect fit, great service.
"
"
Great shoes for a run or walking.  Not comfortable for sitting still for long periods of time due to their form fit around the foot.  The lightness is surprising comforting when walking, and I find these shoes to be very maneuverable.  Highly recommend these shoes for active wear.  Personally, I love the minimalist design.
"
"
I got these as a result of my search for a packable workout/walk-about shoe. The uppers fold flat against the soles for easy packing. I wear size 14 and was struggling for room in my rollerboard - with these I’m set. I use them for workouts and also like how they look for a casual evening out.  They were too small in my size and I had to order 1 size up for a good fit.
"
"
The shoe is very comfortable and in perfect condition. Thanks
"
"
This shoe is one step up from minimalist...but it's just right for me. Not much of a drop from back to front.  I use it as a trainer. Sleek simple design and, of course, lightweight. The soles will trap little pebbles. Not an issue, however. Perhaps I would avoid using it on an indoor track after training outdoors.This is the third pair I've purchased. Put my previous pairs in the clothes washer a few times with no ill effect. Note that I reached back to this 2018 model in late 2021. That's a pretty serious commitment.
"
"
I have a wide footprint so I had to loosen up the shoelaces a good bit to achieve optimal fit, but once done they feel great. The back holds the shoe in place quite well - snug but not too tight, not rubbing on the back. The look is great too. Won’t keep your feet warm, nearly see-through, optimal for summer use. Overall great buy

Justo acabo de recibirlos se ven de muy buena calidad esperemos haber despues de un tiempo de uso.  El color y el diseño es igual al de la imagen que elegi. Recomiendo un numero  mas gran segun tu numero en zapatos. Yo soy 9 1/2 y elegi un 10 y me quedan un poco ajustados, idealmente seria un 10 1/2.  En fin muy recomendados.
"
"
Love how lightweight and cushiony they are
"
"
It look great for the price. But the back is kinda floppy and sole hurts.
"
"
Needed it

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I’m the type to read reviews before making a final decision and if I read two or more, I’m not purchasing the item. But I promise you won’t regret it guys. To in size (8 1/2) and very comfortable and can wear all day. 💕💕💕 I Loveeeee it.

"
i got these thinking it would fit nicely but they don't look good on me and are not comfortable and they run small...
"
"
Me encantaron, su color, su comodidad!! Bien vale su precio
"
"
They are too simple, I thought they were resistant
"
"
I forgot Nikes run narrow, and these soles squeaked even after wearing them for weeks. Decent shoe, though if they fit you.
"
"
They’re super comfortable and light. The color is so vibrant and beautiful. I’m a very big fan of Nike shoes and this did not disappoint. I’m a runner, but I haven’t ran in this, if I do I will update, but I love the look for everyday look and running errands.

Super hermosos … y cómodos …
"
"
Probably the most comfortable trainers I’ve ever worn and excellent value for the price.
"
"
It is as to be expected other than one shoe makes a farting noise with every step.  In high-school it makes them worthless.  Barely a month old and I'm having to buy a new pair. 1st world problems!
"
"
The product wasn’t in the original Nikes box and it looks like is not original the material is to hard not as the original Nikes
"
"
I love these sneakers and they are my go to! Super comfortable and look cute on.
"
"
Cómodos, un poco grandes, usualmente soy 7,5 y pedí esa talla y me quedaron un poquito grandes. Super cómodos y bonitos!
"
"
But the mesh upper was just too transparent and sock-like as with all of the 2090 models.  When these dropped the wide array of colorways had my licking my chops, but sadly they just feel so flimsy.Solid midsole though.  You can definitely feel the stack height.

My son wears an 8 in men's shoes. After reading reviews I bought him an 8 1/2, they weren't big enough. I exchanged them for a 9 1/2, they fit well. I had also ordered him a pair of work boots, they were his regular size 8 and fit him like normal. They are a very well made shoe, and they're sharp 👌 I don't know why they're so much smaller than normal though.
"
"
They look and feel great!!! Shoe lace a little short
"
"
These shoes are beautiful and breathable and great fit length wise. They are tight width wise but stretch to fit after a couple of times wearing them.
"
"
Fit, style and colors
"
"
Shoes are cut very narrow. Tight upon first putting on. Loosening up as they are worn. I assume they will stretch out more with additional wearings. Purchase a half size larger than usual.
"
"
Ran a bit narrow but really nice shoe
"
"
Affordable
"

This is a great lightweight basketball shoe. My older son wears these a lot. My younger son thought the shoes and tongue was bulky and so he didn’t want to keep them. I don’t think this is true but that’s what happens with kids sometimes so we sent them back. But I would highly recommend this shoe as a great light weight mid rise basketball shoe.
"
"
I ordered these because the last 2 pairs of shoes I’ve had were Jordan Chinese New Years and Kyrie 6s. They were both essentially the same style and I really enjoyed the way they felt on my feet.So I pulled the trigger on these without hesitation because they appeared to be what I had become accustomed to. They’re not. They’re not bad however and I would recommend you try them but, at a much lower cost. I’d pay 60$ for these shoes tops. They’re made with this cheap feeling and looking “plastic/mesh” material on the toe and it just doesn’t feel good. The other 2 pairs I had, it was like slipping my foot into a foot glove that hugged me just right. This is like putting my foot into a shell dressed as a shoe. I’m hoping that breaking them in fixes this issue.Also, I don’t care for the tongue of the shoe. idk why, I just don’t.

Bought these for my nephew. He picked out what he wanted

Fit her great she is a 9.5. She has a slightly wide foot and they fit well
"

Great product, love the craftsmanship and most importantly. My grandson loves them
"

Definitely recommend if looking for a reliable pair of basketball shoes. They have great grip, fit as expected, and don't hurt my feet. Excellent overall for competitive basketball. When you hold them, you can just feel the good quality.

Great Kyrie shoe, looks nice, grips the floor great, they are a little narrow, but if you wear them around the house for a few days before playing in them, you should be good to go!
"
"
The shoes are kind of stiff at first and need to be worren in, also the zoom pod placing was not very well thought out there's nothing over it that keeps it from digging into the middle of the bottom of your forefoot. It's so small and sharp since it's triangular shape also concentrates all th pressure it produces underfoot, to a same small area. So after wearing it for while it starts to cause discomfort like when loose lint from your sock builds up in an area or some debre get in your shoe. So if you have any kind of orthopedic issues with your feet I discourage you to buy this shoe. Otherwise it's a pretty decent shoe but in my opinion they could have done a better job with the zoom pod design and placement.

I bought these shoes for my son for his indoor sports, and they have been great.

My son wears an 8 in men's shoes. After reading reviews I bought him an 8 1/2, they weren't big enough. I exchanged them for a 9 1/2, they fit well. I had also ordered him a pair of work boots, they were his regular size 8 and fit him like normal. They are a very well made shoe, and they're sharp 👌 I don't know why they're so much smaller than normal though.
"
"
They look and feel great!!! Shoe lace a little short
"
"
These shoes are beautiful and breathable and great fit length wise. They are tight width wise but stretch to fit after a couple of times wearing them.
"
"
Fit, style and colors
"
"
Shoes are cut very narrow. Tight upon first putting on. Loosening up as they are worn. I assume they will stretch out more with additional wearings. Purchase a half size larger than usual.
"
"
Ran a bit narrow but really nice shoe
"
"
Affordable

This is a great lightweight basketball shoe. My older son wears these a lot. My younger son thought the shoes and tongue was bulky and so he didn’t want to keep them. I don’t think this is true but that’s what happens with kids sometimes so we sent them back. But I would highly recommend this shoe as a great light weight mid rise basketball shoe.
"
"
I ordered these because the last 2 pairs of shoes I’ve had were Jordan Chinese New Years and Kyrie 6s. They were both essentially the same style and I really enjoyed the way they felt on my feet.So I pulled the trigger on these without hesitation because they appeared to be what I had become accustomed to. They’re not. They’re not bad however and I would recommend you try them but, at a much lower cost. I’d pay 60$ for these shoes tops. They’re made with this cheap feeling and looking “plastic/mesh” material on the toe and it just doesn’t feel good. The other 2 pairs I had, it was like slipping my foot into a foot glove that hugged me just right. This is like putting my foot into a shell dressed as a shoe. I’m hoping that breaking them in fixes this issue.Also, I don’t care for the tongue of the shoe. idk why, I just don’t.

I have worn Nike Air shoes for a couple of decades and these are the worst pair of all. The shoe does not bend. It is like walking on a couple of pieces of wood. Your heel hits and then the front of your foot slaps to the ground creating a clip-clop sound when you walk. I walk a lot and thought they would loosen up after a week or two ""break in""  period, but they are still just as rigid as they were when I took them out of the box. They were changing the way I walk and caused some very unexpected muscle pain from the change is stride. Never thought I would say this, but time to switch to another brand.
"
"
Bought for my husband and he liked them but they ran larger then all his other Nike shoes. Overall looked good with his shorts in the summertime.
"
"
Shoe arrived and fit as expected.
"
"
Bought these for a recent Vegas trip and my feet were comfortable walking all over town!
"
"
She loved the way they look and feel.
"
"
Order takes forever to get here and keeps expiring every week
"
"
The shoe arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. Pleasant experience. Will order from this company again.
"
"
Wasn't to sure about these ones but I pulled the trigger and ordered them. They look fire with Nike teTech fits.
"
"
Waited for these to go down on price (98 bucks)_so i sprung on them. Came in quick, the fit and comfort are terrible...but boy these shoes sure look great, i guess thats what you trade in for??? Anyhow i guess i did??
"
"
Probably the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned.

Disappointed. No longer the top sneakers maker. 20 years ago, best on the market. Today no way. Comfort could be better. Value for the money lacking.

Nothing

Super comfortable and fit just right. So much cushioning on the inside.
"

They would have been better if they had an arch support that was a little bigger.
"

Might possibly be the most comfortable Nike sneaker 👟 I've worn as an adult. Breathable & pretty durable
"

very cool looking shoes, and super comfortable. id say they fit true to size, if anything they run a tad bit big.

Great shoes. Crisp, clean, and bright white.

I like these shoes. I've bought Air Max since the beginning. There have been some better than others in my opinion. 2017s, I passed on those😬 The Genome's are comfy as hell (of course), look good and are all around in the top 10 on my list.  YOU WILL NOT BE UNHAPPY WITH THEM!

I’ve had these shoes before in different colors. Normally in he past I’ve had sizing issue with Nike shoes, but this pair fit perfectly. I absolutely reccomend these shoes. I’m ordering another pair in a different color.

I bought a pair for my son at the store and he loved them. Found them on here and he needed school shoes and he wanted them. So I had to buy them.Just wish they wasn’t so expensive on here and I wish u could sell more instead of saying unavailable.
"
"
A bit on the tighter side for 8.5 men.
"
"
Good fit, light, and stylish
"
"
Cheap
"
"
Fits like a glove, they are what I'd hoped for. Just wish it had loop on heal to help pull on
"
"
These are nice shoes, and are of typical Nike quality. They fit well and are true to size.
"

Looks are great. Very comfortable

I bought these for my husband and every-time he wears them for walking he says they are the best pair he’s ever had.

This particular Nike is a little on the hard side. Meaning, there is not as much cushion in the heel when walking, jogging or running as other Nike running shoes on the market.
"
"
Tight fit
"
"
Was very pleased with the product I recieved
"
"
This is my third pair of these shoes.  They last much longer than other tennis shoes I have owned in the past and are light weight and comfortable.
"
"
Overall, it's a good-looking pair of running shoe my kids encouraged me to purchase it. All previous running shoes are size 11 unfortunately Nike 11 squeezes my toes, the front is narrow in hindsight I should have bought size 11.5
"
"
While my son is happy with the fit and comfort, the soles are already separating from the body of the shoes after 6 weeks. He wears them for 3-4 hours a day, so I wouldn’t say that the use is out of the ordinary.  I understand that these are a low-price model of Nike, but I  expected them to hold up longer.
"
"
These Nikes are good quality, light weight, well made and exactly what I was looking for. The mesh uppers let your foot breathe. The soles provide good traction for walking or working out. I haven't experienced any of the ""popping"" sound some of the other reviewers mentioned. Good shoes for the $$$.

Get a full-size larger than usual. - Trust Me! If you wear a 9.5, you will need a 10.5. - Even if you have never ever worn 10.5 before. They simply run small.

These look great and go with almost anything!  Only watch out is for those with a high arch, may need a insert as these don’t give much arch support.

Buenos materiales, buen diseño y muy cómodas...
"

Received it fairly quickly, fit perfectly and are super comfortable! Love them!
"
"
Good quality but the tongue on the left shoe slides into the sneaker. Annoying.The tongue slot and laces line up so I don't think that is it. The shoe fits too, so there can't be that many more options.Maybe there is an easy way to fix this. But for the price, I shouldn't have to.That's why I gave it 3 stars.
"
"
In the description of the shoes it said that they are made of leather. When I received them, it was clear that they are not leather and inside they had a sticker saying ""UPPER CONTAINS SYNTHETIC LEATHER"". Therefore they are not shoes made of leather but synthetic leather.

La comodidad e inversión es excente.  La elegancia de estas tennis ha sido el gusto de muchas personas que la han visto.  El vendedor cumplió con sus expectativas.  Llego como esperado

Decent will recommend
"

These look great and go with almost anything!  Only watch out is for those with a high arch, may need a insert as these don’t give much arch support.

Love My NIKE TENNIS SHOES…A MUST BUY!❤️
"
"
👍
"
"
Comfortable and cool looking clean lines not over stated so I can wear just about anything with them.
"
"
Buenos materiales, buen diseño y muy cómodas...
"
"
Received it fairly quickly, fit perfectly and are super comfortable! Love them!
"
"
Good quality but the tongue on the left shoe slides into the sneaker. Annoying.The tongue slot and laces line up so I don't think that is it. The shoe fits too, so there can't be that many more options.Maybe there is an easy way to fix this. But for the price, I shouldn't have to.That's why I gave it 3 stars.
"
"
In the description of the shoes it said that they are made of leather. When I received them, it was clear that they are not leather and inside they had a sticker saying ""UPPER CONTAINS SYNTHETIC LEATHER"". Therefore they are not shoes made of leather but synthetic leather.
"
"
Had a pair before, this new pair was just as perfect as the last
"
"
I like it a lot.
"
"
Love my sneakers but the shipper was slow as molasses to ship my item .Almost like it was shipped from China smh .I didn’t have the option to cancel this order .If I did I would have canceled .
"
"
It doesn’t hurt my feet
"
"
Good quality and fast shipping
"
"
Good shoes.  Purchased a second pair
"
"

"
"

"
"

Great shoe can't go wrong with Nike air Max
"
"
Thank you
"

Great looking shoe. Immediate compliments. Was a little worried by the reviews and was half expecting fakes but they seem legit to me. For the price I paid they better be! A little snug for us wide foots but not too much. Also the insoles a little stiff but I can still walk comfortably in them and would def recommend. Will be back to update on endurance over time.
"
"
The shoe fits well, but after wearing the shoe for 5 minutes where the laces start at the bottom of the shoe above the toes it starts hurting the top of my foot.  I have never had a pair of shoes do this.  The pain becomes so intense the shoes become unwearable.  Just a waste of money.  The real rating is no stars!!!
"
"
There was nothing wrong with the shoebox or the shoes,
"
"
Nike come back to integrity. And the the desire to be the best.
"

I purchased these shoes and my excitement was quickly turned to disappointment. When spending you know $100+ on a new pair of shoes, you expect the shoes to be you know, new. They were shipped shortly after purchasing, and arrived in a timely manner, that was great. What wasn’t great, was taking them out of the package and getting ready to wear them, and upon initial inspection seeing that the shoes looked worn, had scuff marks, minor creasing, smudges, scratches and some weird red stuff on the top of the toes. I’m pretty disappointed and very unsatisfied with that.
"
"
I bought these as a gift and I am very disappointed. Poor stitching work, glue on the shoes, and random stains! Not to mention the box they come in was in such poor condition, it’s clear the quality of your item is not their priority. Save yourself the disappointment and shop somewhere else!!

I have ordered this same shoe and size at least 5 times over this pair had some different pattern, different soles, didn’t come in the original manufacturer box, and was too small to fit my foot despite the tag saying it was a 10.5 which is what I always get for this exact shoe. Clearly a fake knockoff scam.
"
"
Shoes are nice
"
"
Was tight/narrow. A hole is starting at the tip of the right big toe. Are these knock offs?
"
"
I am a woman who owns Nike Tanjun sneakers in various colors, so I ordered these for my son.  He agrees that these are the best feeling sneakers he has ever worn!  He has been wearing them for months, and they still look & feel like new.  They are totally fashionable, but most of all, they offer extreme comfort that you just can't find in other sneakers.  The fit is true to size,  but most MEN can go up 1/2 size for the best comfort you've ever felt.  The Fashion & Comfort factors are 100 stars!!!  (And btw, my 90 year old dad also LOVES wearing Nike Tanjuns, and his 73 yr old wife too!  Proof that these are not just for 18 yr olds! :)  Best to wait & get them when the price is equal or lower than shopping at DSW or other online shoe stores.  Enjoy!
"
"
I’ve only been wearing them for about a month and the tread is gone. I am a PE teacher so I move around, but enough to go through a pair of shoes on one month.  The soles are already flat. Overpriced for the life of the product.
"
"
Was very happy when newly purchased, however shoe is not made well and does not age well. Quality issues throughout the shoe, no tread is left after semi-regular wear and 5 months time.
"
"
Wanted to get some Roshe's for nostalgia's sake, but learned that they're not in production anymore. This was the next best thing in production. They're comfortable, but just very narrow. I wouldn't want to wear these for long periods of time, every day, because I care about foot health
"
"
My Nike Tanjun's fit perfectly. The sneakers are lightweight and feel good on my feet.
"
"
As others have noted there isn't a whole lot of support and ironically, it's biggest advantage is also its biggest drawback... Not as much support, feet slide a little. And for some reason (materials?) these shoes absorb foot odor too well. After 2 month I was shocked to smell my shoes after 2-3 runs a week. On the positives side they do well in the washer. A gentle cycle and light amount of detergent had them smelling and looking like new.

I wear Nike sneakers because they fit my arch perfectly, where most other brands the arch feels too high. The size across styles is always true. I’m about to go on vacation and my other Nikes were just not up to another week of lots of walking. These are SOOO comfortable,
"
"
I’m a painting contractor and on my feet all day, so when I googled top 10 most comfortable shoes, these were #1 with Adidas cloudfoam ultimate #2 (or visa versa). Then I found these here on AMZN, and after reading all the excellent reviews about them, I decided to purchase. Well, I wear a size 11, so I ordered a pair of cloudfoam ultimates and a pair of these in my size, but these are too short. My big toe is about to bust through the fabric when walking around my house for 5 min. So I’m returning and because they don’t have an 11-1/2 available in the color I want, I purchased another pair of cloudfoam ultimates. With that being said, these shoes are extremely comfortable and lightweight. Almost can’t even tell I’m wearing shoes. If they had a half size larger, I would have exchanged for a pair that fit.
"
"
Very happy with delivery and shoe.. fits perfectly.
"
"
I wear these for daily activities.  The toe area is a little tight but still comfortable
"
"
I bought these shoes for an autistic 18 year old young man. He had a pair just like them same shoe. I bought him a different brand of new shoes and he would not wear them. He had been wearing his old shoes for almost 2 years. They really held up good. So I bought him a new pair. The shoes fit just like the old ones. Good width, toebox and arch support. He likes them a lot.
"
"
Lightweight shoe but zero toe protection so they are difficult to wear at work etc without the issue of a foot injury.
"
"
Second pair of these and so long as you know to order up 1/2 size, you're good!
"
"
Never been a Nike shoe fan but wanted to give these shoes a try since its on Google's Top 10 most comfortable shoes list and voted #2. Wanted something comfortable to wear for work since my job requires more than half of my day standing and walking around. I'd say these are nice to wear but #2 most comfortable shoes, nahh! Find something else. They look nice though, thats a plus.

Air max lost air after 3-4 months. Bubble popped. Bubble is exposed on bottom of shoe so after a few months normal wear and tear right shoe is ruined. Paid about $100 per month. Ridiculous for the amount they cost I expected to have for years.
"
"
I really liked these sneakers but key word but, after receiving them the left sneaker toe was all dented then upon return received second pair and the right sneaker toe was dented . Don't know why this is . First time I received dented sneakers lol so I asked for a refund . Paying $170 for a pair of sneakers they should not be dented anywhere .
"
"
They were to tight
"
"
Love it thanks guys I’ll order another color it’s worth the money thanks
"
"
Perfect fit great shoes I love them
"

I have been buying the same shoe with different colors (presently I have 7 pairs).  Is this shoe the best for everyone?? NO.  I run about 4 miles a day and it provides great support
"

Not true to size

Lo uso diariamente, son muy cómodas

It's take a little longer to come than expected but it fit well and looks good.

I actually bought the “used” pair. As stated, they were used like new and they were. Bottom of shoes were clean and so was the inside. The shoes are just what I was expecting. The only thing I don’t like is that the tongue is stitched to the shoe not allowing a full free open motion on it. Overall I’m happy with my purchase.
"
"
Excellent shoes
"
"
muy agusto al caminar, y sobre todo el color
"
"
Love the look, and they’re fine for hanging out but any extensive running (or even long walk) would be better served with a real running shoe.
"
"
Like the color and fit after stretching them with a shoe stretcher for 48hrs . Stil need to stretch them a bit more for the perfect feel and fit. So if you going to buy and have wide and high feet buy a bigger size or prepare to stretch them for a while.
"
"
Great for support for bad ankles
"
"
Love how the air feels, great running shoe..
"

Excelent...

I was skeptical on purchasing from this site after reading the mixed reviews. Ordered on Black Friday received on Sunday. As far as I can tell 100% authentic.
"
"
It was a gift for my son. He loved them and he receives a lot of compliments
"
"
My son loves these shoes they fit as expected and are nice and bright.
"
"
Love my new shoes!!!

"
They were as expected
"
"
100% Authentic

These are exactly what I ordered and I’m very pleased with them. Though they’re probably off brand they’re still cool looking.

If you are looking for an all white sneaker that’s fairly comfortable this is it. Don’t get the gum bottoms they have the worst traction. Make sure the sneakers have a white bottom. They look good and you can get them fairly priced.
"

Absolutely loved this.
"
"
Perfect

Am a size 10 but this kne looks to be one size more

Thank you

This product is value of money and comes with good style

They were all black & fit fine. That's it.

Look and fit great. Good value.

If this is not your first pair, look extra carefully at all others available from different buyers.  The same size and style model ones I have in white are way more roomy. These feel like a 9.1/2 narrow
"
"
My son thinks these shoes are great! They are great quality and fit well.  He is a happy teenager!!

Bought these shoes for my daughter, so far she loves them and they fit well.
"
"
Seems a bit soft (upper) but fits properly
"
"
I like these shoes with the style and look but have to say they are uncomfortable when out the box not very soft or cushioning. When I’m walking they are hard and sounds like I’m wearing boots or a heavy dress shoe so not good when trying to not be noticed or wake up the kids when leaving for work

Dang. I bought another 4 pairs of these. Comfort heaven straight out of the box. The only issue is that the shoe strings cannot stay tied for anything - even in double knots...it's very odd - and this is the case on all the pairs. Other than that, wow.
"
"
Wrong color came and they were way too small!
"
"
I hope Nike never stops making these shoes. There are a couple of minor negatives. The soles are prone to pick up pebbles and the sole wears quickly. Even so, the 5-star rating is well deserved. The shoes are the barefoot feel type. I'm starting my third consecutive pair since 2013. As long as these shoes are available, I'll never wear anything else.
"
"
I set a goal of 350 miles on my Nike app for these shoes but I suspect I'll get many more than that before they are ready for sneaker heaven. I'm just starting to get into serious runs (a few weeks shy of my 49th birthday) and found these recommended on a website. They certainly are lightweight and fit very well. My first run took me 6.6 miles which is the most I've done to this point so right now they have been more than worth it. Nike doesn't disappoint and the free run only adds to their vast legend.
"
"
Bought these and they are comfortable, form fitting and they don’t move around. Keeps your foot snug and like the other 1,000,000 reviews, the verdict is buy, buy, buy again. You deserve these shoes. Don’t miss out on this opportunity.
"
"
Se loa compre para mi esposo, la talla es un poco más pequeña de lo usual, el es talla 10, pero con estas zapatillas creo sería un 10.5, lo recomiendo, el dice que son muy cómodas.
"

I’ve been wearing these for a couple months now and I’ve decided that they’re the most comfortable shoes that I’ve ever put on my feet.
"
"
These are light & comfortable. They are perfect for working out or just to have on throughout the day. I would buy these again 10/10.
"
"
Is great shoes but the soles color is horrible.
"
"
as a lifelong Nike fan, I have had dozens of their shoes. This is definitely the most comfortable for walking or easy jogging. Very versatile and I like them a lot.  Assuming they continue making them I will buy another pair before long.

The best shoes out there for running. Coming from someone who works out and run track, there are excellent
"
"
Very nice
"

It was so tight that my wife had to help me put it on. The way the tongue is connected to the inner shoe makes it a problem to put on. The arch was so hard that after walking just ten minutes my feet hurt so bad it was unbearable. I had to take them off. Then and there I knew I had to return them for a refund. I would advise not to buy shoes on line. Only buy shoes you can try on before you purchase them. Disappointed!
"
"
Nike no longer makes quality products that fit consistenly, we all know why, they are nike and they can mass produce synthetic human fecal matter and people would still buy it....
"
"
Most comfortable shoe I've ever owned. As a nurse I'm on my feet all day and love them!!
"
"
This is the worst nikes shoes I have ever bought . There’s too many small holes in the soles and the pebbles gets stuck like crazy. I only wore it like few days and the pebbles have already made a hole in the soles. Do not buy this shoes . I am returning it .
"

Purchased as a gift and fit was perfect.  Did not have to return for a larger size.

They feel like I’m just pulling on socks

These shoes look really good. The quality is very high. These are the perfect option to buy instead of expensive Air Force ones. These look flashy and feel very comfortable. I would recommend for anyone!
"
"
I like everything.The order process was very easy and smooth.
"

Yeah these fit good and are comfortable but feel like clown shoes when i wear them,i look down and i just don't care for the style and to many holes on top of the toes.i am a Court Lite and a Defy All Day Nike kind of lover.

Purchased these for my eldest son. He had another pair the school year before and liked them so much, he decided he wanted them again over other pairs that he was offered. He loves to comfort and ease of putting them on, and likes the way they look with different attire, I.e. shorts, jeans, sweatpants, socks on or no socks.
"
"
Nice comfortable shoes
"
"
Foot bed is close to correct size (maybe a little small), but shoes are very much too narrow or otherwise improperly sized sideways and bind feet (though marked as a normal size 11, Not ""narrow""). First time ever (in decades) a Nike running shoe has had this problem. Have consistently returned to Nike BECAUSE they use a relatively narrow last, which fits my feet, but this is abnormally narrow. Are these just very old stock, or mis-manufactured, or maybe knock-offs ? They do look ever so slightly ""off"" from familiar normal Nike production appearance. Seems like a very old design -- though Exactly what I wanted -- which Nike apparently no longer makes (and has not for a very long time). Not clear where they come from, and they are annoyingly snug, which is puzzling, but they are mostly wearable just moderately uncomfortable since too snug. This color not available in larger sizes.
"
"
Very comfortable shoes
"
"
My husband loves all Nike Air Max - these are a nice addition to his collection
"
"
Cannot be worn, after two months of wear. Very disappointing given cost of sneaker. They are not worn daily.
"
"
During the 2nd week of wearing these, the air cushion popped, and now it makes a sound with every other step.  Would have returned them but hadn't kept the box.  Grrr.

Are these just very old stock, or mis-manufactured, or maybe knock-offs ? They do look ever so slightly ""off"" from familiar normal Nike production appearance. Seems like a very old design -- though Exactly what I wanted -- which Nike apparently no longer makes (and has not for a very long time). Not clear where they come from, and they are annoyingly snug, which is puzzling, but they are mostly wearable just moderately uncomfortable since too snug. This color not available in larger sizes.

"
Very comfortable shoes
"
"
My husband loves all Nike Air Max - these are a nice addition to his collection
"
"
Cannot be worn, after two months of wear. Very disappointing given cost of sneaker. They are not worn daily.
"
"
During the 2nd week of wearing these, the air cushion popped, and now it makes a sound with every other step.  Would have returned them but hadn't kept the box.  Grrr.
"
"
They shouldn't be as high priced for the product
"
"
This shoes looks cheap, can’t believe Nike shoes look so cheap and cost $140, sent them back.
"
"
These sneakers run a full size too big and the material is very cheap for a Nike shoe. I have another pair of air max purchased directly from Nike and these are nothing alike. Very disappointed as I did not try them or attempt to wear them until after the return date
"
"
Llego en buen estado y a tiempo
"
"
My shoes got wet in the rain and the blue spread all over the cloth making them non wearable.
"
"
I wear and 11.5 and they run big. Should of ordered an 11
"
"
The Black/White/Red model has a defect of front Black material will color dyed into white front part, if the show has been wet or in raining situation as photo shown, each will have different color fading effect, this teach a lesson when choose the multi-colors Nike shoe, always pickup front is light color or one color tone design!
"
"
Good fitting pair of shoes
"
"
He like it alot
"
"
Perfect fit. Good value for the money. My Son loves it!
"
"
Great qualityPackage was ruffed up-  smashed, ripped , had to remove from package to hand as a gift ..but the product untouched.
"
"
Comfort and Style
"
"
Wide feet won’t like the fit, but they work for me. Really like the colors on this one.
"
"
Purchased these for my eldest son. He had another pair the school year before and liked them so much, he decided he wanted them again over other pairs that he was offered. He loves to comfort and ease of putting them on, and likes the way they look with different attire, I.e. shorts, jeans, sweatpants, socks on or no socks.

I think when they were making this pair, they got the sizes mixed up. I’m still able to make them work, just had to get longer laces.
"
"
I really like these shoes (attractive, good fit) for general wear and the heel support is very good (rigid).  The one issue many online users have pointed out for many years is an adhesive problem between rubber sole and leather upper and I, as well, have experienced this although relatively well into the sneakers' expected life.  Nike could benefit from addressing this issue.

FIRST TIME BUYING SHOES ON LINE,WORKED OUT GREAT  5 BIG STARS

For my son's upcoming birthday. He will definitely love them.

I've worn the Monarch lV 4E Nikes for years! I started wearing boots and developed Plantar Fasciitis. I've went back to these shoes. They are the only shoes that I can walk comfortably in. I work the dock. Nothing else compares. If they ever stop making these I'm screwed!
"
"
Shoes Are exactly what I expected fit like I expected and delivered on the day they said it would be.
"
"
Bought x wide only to save a few bucks and hoped they'd fit. Guess what- they did. ; )
"

Like the shoes, but would really like a little more coverage at the Heel / Ankle Area.

I’ve had other shoes in the past that were Nike and they have been always great, the one time I decided to try Adidas because they were cheaper than air forces so I went with the Adidas hoops 2.0 same sort of style as the air forces and they were the most uncomfortable shoes I’ve ever had, they made the skin on the sides of my feet red, then I got the air forces and noticed a big difference, the comfortability was great no foot irritation, no discomfort, i should have known that was a mistake you get what you pay for I guess

It took a couple days to break them in and I had to remove the top strap because it looks better without it. Otherwise they are very comfortable and easy to care for.
"
"
The shoes are true to size. It arrived with the box damaged and there was some creases. All of that aside very nice and comfy.

Excelente diseño y material. Calzado con estilo de la epoca de los 80'. Me encanta!

I read the book Shoe Dog by Phil Knight; got impressed by the story of Nike. And decided to join a group of fans of this brand – fantastic quality, light and very comfortable
"
"
Most comfortable shoe I have had in years!
"
"
Run true to size and fit comfortable
"
"
Fit great an came quick but one was lil torn on side an look like be tryed on cuz was not package right an shoe laces were not tied or an strench out
"
"
If you have chunky feet like me, I suggest you go up a 1/2 size or 1 size bigger. This is something I will keep in mind next time I order them. I really love them and love how they look on my feet! Will definitely buy again.
"

Leather stripe peel of after six months of use . Nike is not a great quality anymore like it use to be and the price is still very high compare with other brands . Disapointed after my two previous purchases . Will switch to Adidas or Reebok in the future !
"
"
I have long been a customer of Nike trainers but this is the first pair that failed to impress. There is zero arch support and the heel has no cushioning either. They might work as a gym shoe but are not comfortable for walking.
"
"
Inside construction is poor
"
"
It’s soft  and comfortable but price is high .
"
"
My first choice were the 270s but couldn't find them in all black and these are not as comfortable as those but they definitely do the job. Good buy.
"
"
I have been wearing nike shoes my entire life and these are the worst shoes i have ever worn.There is no way in hell these are running shoes as advertised. They have ZERO ankle support, compared to a pair of nike shoes i bought 10 years ago and still use these cushions are practically non existent, and the treads are a joke.If you use these shoes for anything more then a casual walk YOU WILL GET INJURED. I would demand a refund if I could but i made the mistake of not trying the shoes out until a week ago.These shoes are worth MAYBE $40.00 and are without a doubt not worth the price of $120-$140 or whatever it was that i paid for them.The quality of these nike shoes are so bad I have serious doubts that these are LEGI NIKE SHOES
"

So far the shoes feel good.  Hopefully they last.

Great winter sneaker boots
"
"
The in side look like it's cheap or fake
"
"
These shoes are marketed as “sneaker boots” which is a good description.  They’re primarily marketed as winter shoes that are weatherproof.  I just say they’re comfortable and seem durable like all Nikes and fit well.  The Nike box looked like it was run over by some sort of equipment and was held together with tape and rubber bands but the shoes weren’t damaged so it’s okay.  These are made of synthetic materials that will stand up to the elements, no leather.
"
"
Great Kicks!!! Fully weatherproof. Rain, Snow, puddles, feet stay dry. Very true uniform fit. I’m a size 8.5 and they fit as should. Material is resilient. Photos are from a near every day for aprox 3 months of wear. Any dust, dirt, grime, oils, ect simply let it dry and then whip it off with a hot wet towel and they look like new again. I use toe decrease’rs but worn for about 2 weeks without and the material always settled back to form after sitting over night. They are light weight and comfortable. They have a nice upper ankle support helps keep feet’s warm without the excessive cushioning. I don’t lace my shoes tight or all the way up the eyelets so when you walk in these you can hear the upper metal eyelets clicking makes for a nice subtle unique sound that I do enjoy. I’m a Nike and Jordan guy it’s all I own. These are now in my top 5 favorites. Going to buy a backup pair of Black’s for dressing up as well as the kaki color ones. And keep the ones I already have as a every day multi use shoe as they are good for style, weather conditions, b-ball, and every day use. Great buy. Great product. Great design. Well worth the price, might even say their under priced! Def recommend buying if you like the classic Nike look but want versatility or have a kid that abuses their shoes as they will hold up.
"
"
So everyone understand, you not getting a gym shoes or basketball shoes It’s more like if the weather is 40 degrees and it’s raining out.Now the question isWould I ever buy another pair down the rdNever. Product doesn’t worth the money.

This is the most comfortable shoe I have had in a while. I'm on my feet for 6 hours straight and most of that is on a metal grating and no discomfort at all. Very happy you had these because Nike didn't. Thank you

Very comfortable and they fit perfectly. No complaints.

This shoe passed my expectations. I use them for work. They are very comfortable and flashy. Get complimented on them a lot.

Great winter sneaker boots

The in side look like it's cheap or fake

These shoes are marketed as “sneaker boots” which is a good description.  They’re primarily marketed as winter shoes that are weatherproof.  I just say they’re comfortable and seem durable like all Nikes and fit well.  The Nike box looked like it was run over by some sort of equipment and was held together with tape and rubber bands but the shoes weren’t damaged so it’s okay.  These are made of synthetic materials that will stand up to the elements, no leather.

Great Kicks!!! Fully weatherproof. Rain, Snow, puddles, feet stay dry. Very true uniform fit. I’m a size 8.5 and they fit as should. Material is resilient. Photos are from a near every day for aprox 3 months of wear. Any dust, dirt, grime, oils, ect simply let it dry and then whip it off with a hot wet towel and they look like new again. I use toe decrease’rs but worn for about 2 weeks without and the material always settled back to form after sitting over night. They are light weight and comfortable. They have a nice upper ankle support helps keep feet’s warm without the excessive cushioning. I don’t lace my shoes tight or all the way up the eyelets so when you walk in these you can hear the upper metal eyelets clicking makes for a nice subtle unique sound that I do enjoy. I’m a Nike and Jordan guy it’s all I own. These are now in my top 5 favorites. Going to buy a backup pair of Black’s for dressing up as well as the kaki color ones. And keep the ones I already have as a every day multi use shoe as they are good for style, weather conditions, b-ball, and every day use. Great buy. Great product. Great design. Well worth the price, might even say their under priced! Def recommend buying if you like the classic Nike look but want versatility or have a kid that abuses their shoes as they will hold up.

Just a note is not real. I brought it to Nike store to get some inserts and new laces and a possibility to exchange to another side they wanna to call the police on me saying it was a fake product and I was trying to counterfeit them. Was crazy. Looks really original and is super beautiful. But brother loved and kept it.

For myself they fit perfectly and I have no dislike about these Nikes❤️👍🏼

One of the shoes I received was defective, but the seller was great and got them to me faster than expected.
"
"
They run a bit small and the toe box is very tight. Be sure to order a size up for comfort
"
"
I typically wear a 10 in nike women's shoes so I ordered a 9.5 in men's size and they were perfect. Nike does have a narrow toe box so if youre wide, these aren't for you.
"
"
Works good
"
"
Would have liked the box to show up complete since we paid for them.
"
"
Me agrado mucho y son muy cómodas para hacer ejercicio
"
"
Awesome performance in my GYM training, fully recomended
"
"
El chulito de Nike no venía completo
"
"
Looks great, they feel great
"
"
I wore these for 2 days assuming they could be stretched out, but instead it chaffed and ripped some skin from the front of my ankle. The angle of the toes is too narrow and feels like your big toe is being pushed towards your other toes.

The shoe is really tight-fitting and tore up my heel to the point I haven’t worn them in over a week while my heel heals.  Hoping the stretch a bit or I’ll be returning them.
"

Nice gift quality. Sturdy soles and stitching.
"
"
Muy contentos con mi compraMe gusta mucho el diseño y precio
"
"
I have wide feet and these fit really well, rare for a Nike for my feet.  VERY stable.
"
"
True to size and comfortable. The shoe really looks good in the pictures, but better in person.
"
"
Light weight, comfortable, and reasonable…I like them.
"
"
Had to return them Because one of the shoes was made with a defect.
"
"
Came quick. Shoes felt good after first few times. Noticed right exterior sole has come apart from shoe after about 6 miles of normal walking. Nike sign is worn off and inside tag is suspect of this show not actually being real. Size 12 but the left is more of a 13 and the right is a 11.

They were a little tigh but it may e just that I have wide feet

Bought these for my dad, they fit perfectly. Very true to size

the most comfortable running shoes i've ever owned... no BS. the soles are so squishy and bouncy and really absorbs all the shock while running alleviating pain, fatigue, chin splints, plantar fasciitis etc. They are stable so you get a good secure lockdown so your foot doesn't move all around when running. Highly recommend 10/10

This is spouse’s second Nike React Infinity Run Flyknit 2 Running Shoes. It gives the best comfort for his everyday use. Thank you !!Note : Spouse has flat feet and his normal best fit is 9.5, however for this one he has to go for 10 for the best comfort.

Very nice and extremely comfortable. Like walking on a mattress.

This so far has been a great workout shoe. Has a very flexible sole and breathable material. I don’t think I would run in them but fitness bike, elliptical or stair stepper is fine.
"
"
These shoes are designed for running and actually they are great for that. Sole cushioning works perfect by lowering impact on both feet and knees.
"
"
Got them a size too big but ok put insoles…. Comfy but prefer solid fabric not stretchy
"

Great support. Very comfortable and cute just like the photo.

Read a lot of bad reviews before buying that said  they couldn’t get their foot in the shoe 😂 you’ve got to be smarter than the shoe people.  Use the back tabs.  This shoe is 🔥
"
"
Very tight fit even though 10 and a half it felt like a nine and a half
"
"
Wonderful gift my my basketball boy:-) he truly love it!!! So comfortable he said.
"
"
Wore the shoes for about five minutes and my right shoe squeaks real bad like there’s an air pouch broke in the soul. Sending back and I will assume I will have to send these back and wait on another pair. In the mean time wear the same shoes that I was replacing as everyday wear.
"
"
Great shoes
"
"
I'm very happy with the customer service I will continue shopping on Amazon
"

Can someone explain to me how I should put my foot in this sports shoe with a size 11. The entrance is way too small. No getting in without hurting the shoe. Completely useless for me.
"

Price was high then came down to $79.95. I paid $209.99. Lets see what happens . not satisfied

 I bought these as I birthday gift for someone that I live with as he only wears Nikes. We both do & he absolutely loves them! They look very stylish on & are very comfortable which is a huge plus because I've had to make a lot of returns on past Nikes I have bought him because not all are comfortable for him. These have a solid back & toe area but medium thickness softer material on the top & sides within the hard cage design pattern altho it's not that soft material that shows your toes.. It's thicker than that. I'm not sure if it's waterproof... I'll go back & read the description... Though it does look it but if not they are worth buying a can of water proof spray because we love the bottoms which are high enough to to keep them above most puddles & the wet season & the smaller nubs look good for winter. Originally purchased the blk/blk but had to exchange for a larger size & they were all sold out so only next option was that blk/grey & there's really no difference! We're both very happy with this pair! Seller very responsive & ships quickly  5 stars
"
"
Someone may have tried one of them on.  The paper placed inside the shoe to keep its shape was missing and the sole had minor signs of use(dust/dirt). The other shoe was immaculate. The person i gave them to as a gift loves them.
"
"
Finally figured out what size I needed in men's ( i wear 11 in women and got 10 in mens) and it was just what I was looking for.
"
"
Comfortable. But most of all they look badass. I get compliments all the time!!
"
"
Love them but they get dirty
"
"
me agrado
"
"
he like the way they fit.
"
"
I was very satisfied with product no dislikes
"
"
pricey
"
"
The shoes lived up to my expectations

Though it does look it but if not they are worth buying a can of water proof spray because we love the bottoms which are high enough to to keep them above most puddles & the wet season & the smaller nubs look good for winter. Originally purchased the blk/blk but had to exchange for a larger size & they were all sold out so only next option was that blk/grey & there's really no difference! We're both very happy with this pair! Seller very responsive & ships quickly  5 stars

Someone may have tried one of them on.  The paper placed inside the shoe to keep its shape was missing and the sole had minor signs of use(dust/dirt). The other shoe was immaculate. The person i gave them to as a gift loves them.
"
"
Finally figured out what size I needed in men's ( i wear 11 in women and got 10 in mens) and it was just what I was looking for.
"
"
Comfortable. But most of all they look badass. I get compliments all the time!!
"
"
Love them but they get dirty
"

me agrado

he like the way they fit.

I was very satisfied with product no dislikes

pricey
"

I love this sneaker but it said it was delivered but I never received them@#$%!

Very nice

 I bought these as I birthday gift for someone that I live with as he only wears Nikes. We both do & he absolutely loves them! They look very stylish on & are very comfortable which is a huge plus because I've had to make a lot of returns on past Nikes I have bought him because not all are comfortable for him.

I debated a yr about spending that kinda money on a pr of shoes cause I'm always outdoors & on my feet &tend to fly through pairs of shoes but after receiving these the only regret I have is not getting them a yr sooner
"
"
Great fit!! Looks great!
"
"
Definite buy for any dark black fit.
"
"
The toe box is tight. It took a week to stretch the material to a comfortable level. Afterwards they fit great with the exception of toe box being to pointed.
"
"
There a little tight , I ordered 8’s n they feel like 7’s
"
"
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
"
"
It runs little narrow than I expected. Compensate by wearing thinner socks. Great heel support! No more pain at end of the day .
"
"
These were purchased for my house mate. He has a pair of these that are a few years old and said they were beyond comfortable.  These he wore half the day, came home and changed them.They have been returned and he wanted no more.
"
"
So what a great shoe until a few weeks later and the break/crack happens! Come on NIKE 200.00 bucks for a few weeks of wear! #unacceptable

The seller of these gym shoes are a authentic Nike seller I'm so happy with my purchase the gym shoes is everything the way it was described and there are so comfortable a great running shoe

Some products fit differently than others. I wear a size 13 but this fits like a size 12. Feet were hurting too much, hence the return of the product.

Love these and now I have the white pair. Perfect addition to collection

Love these nikes

Shipped right in time before Christmas and received the first day within the window of reception dates. Great shoe, fits perfect and exactly as expected. Great experience all around. A perfect gift for my husband. Highly recommend product and seller. You made my Christmas with this last minute order - thank you!
"
"
Still trying to break them in, its a bit painful with the bigger size. Just afraid that if I go with an even bigger size shoe will not fit correctly.
"

There was nothing wrong with this product.

Great shoes, but a little thinner than I was expecting. Also can’t wear no show socks, as the back of the shoe is rough and cuts into your heel
"

Es un calzado espectacular
"
"
My son was happy. Great price.
"

The shoes are very light, comfy and my feet can breathe.

I bought white and black.  white fit perfect bought both same size black had to be replaced 2 more times till correct in size
"

on hard footwear should use pads, others are good to wear.

Shoes ok, but came in an odd plain box with size scribbled in marker. Was a gift so used a Nike box I had. For that price should have had a regular Nike box.
"
"
Me quedo un poco grande pero no está mal
"
"
I bought it after looking at the collar with the sensibility of the old memories, but when I got it delivered, the color is a total failure.
"
"
great shoe that you can dress up or down. the color is unique compared to the classic blue swoosh everyone gets, but this shoe color scheme is just as versatile and goes with most outfits
"
"
Not so good materials
"
"
Very versatile shoe
"
"
I have had my blue killshots for ever and now work for a company who's color is green, so these are awesome to rock at the office.
"
"
Would buy again! Fit as expected.
"
"
Walking Around carefully trying to keep them bright white lol. Cool retro look comfy shoes to wear to Starbucks or maybe the mall. Walkers.

It took me some time to find these, I mean literally like 3 hours of scrolling through the Nike app until I saw them. They had all of the things I like about the blazer lows but better! They don’t have the foam which I don’t personally love and they look great! I highly recommend them. A bonus thing was I forgot my basketball shoes for practice and they had really good traction. While they don’t have ankle support they do have great traction!
"
"
It came in an eco box but other than that I’m loving the shoes
"

Los tenis tiene gran estilo pero no ofrecen mucho confort y las medidas se salen de lo estándar tanto en lo estrechos que son, como en lo largos. Yo tengo pies delgados y aún así me quedan un poco estrechos, para una persona con pie normal, no los recomendaría porque le tallarían mucho, de forma insoportable puedo decir. Adicionalmente son un poco más largos que la talla estándar, aproximadamente media talla. También me parece que le falta abollonado.
"
"
this item was a gift for someone else, so I can't rate it
"
"
I bought these to latch my fall colors. I sizes down so they would fit. I love them
"
"
Listen - I will be 100% honest, I am not entirely sure if this product is completely authentic. I find it a little suspect that mine and many others came in an unmarked box that said “original box was damaged in shipping” and these items are completely unavailable on the Nike store. However, I do not notice any flaws or disparities and they look exactly like they should. As far as I know they’re legit. The style of this shoe is timeless and unmatched, would happily purchase again. I would recommend maybe ordering half a size down.
"
"
Nice sneakers. Look great
"
"
Have been on a white sneaker kick recently.Got these Nikes recently and are now my favorite white (although swoosh isn't white) pair to wear nice and stylish with nice retro look
"
"
I like the shoes felt extremely comfortable and they're high quality. What I dislike is they get dirty easily but if you maintain cleanliness they stay the same.

These are very stable shoes.  Good for lateral movement or weight lifting.  In my opinion they are a bit short for the size. Otherwise would be a 5 star rating. They appear exactly as in the description photo.
"
"
Fue mi primer compra y fue genial
"
"
The width is too tight, ordered thesame brand different color size and width is perfect, but this one is the same size but the width is tight.
"
"
The shoes are light weight and provide the support my knees require when doing HIIT workouts.  Highly recommend.
"
"
para personas de pie ancho y empeine alto deberian comprar una talla más
"
"
Might be the widest Nike shoe I have ever worn, perfect for folks that need a wider toe box! The fit is not too tight but not loose at all. 2 weeks of owning and I believe this is the best pair of Nike shoes I have ever owned!
"
"
After minimal use, these shoes began ripping apart at the side toe area. Very soon after that the toe ripped off completely. Not sure if it was a knock-off shoe or Nike just puts out garbage, but yeah. Good luck.
"
"
Jogging and work out
"
"
They came i perfect condition and fit perfectly.Will buy them again.
"
"
One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes right out of the box. Great support for HIIT and other high intensity training.

After minimal use, these shoes began ripping apart at the side toe area. Very soon after that the toe ripped off completely. Not sure if it was a knock-off shoe or Nike just puts out garbage, but yeah. Good luck.
"
"
Jogging and work out
"
"
They came i perfect condition and fit perfectly.Will buy them again.
"
"
One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes right out of the box. Great support for HIIT and other high intensity training.

Este zapato lo compré como regalo para mi esposo, por referencia de una influencer a la que sigo, quien lo recomendaba por su comodidad. Decidí comprarlo directamente por Amazon debido a que la página web de Nike no me permitió hacerlo, aunque esto representara un costo mucho mayor (US$90.00 Amazon vs US$45.00 Nike.con) Lo adquirí en sept 2021, a mi esposo le encantó. Sin embargo, ya en Enero 2022 como menos de 7 posturas presenta deterioro inminente, la tela se está abriendo de un costado, como si se tratara de un calzado viejo o con mucho tiempo de uso. Cada resaltar que, mi esposo solo ha utilizado el calzado para salir de forma casual, a pesar de ser un zapato deportivo no lo utiliza para hacer deportes.
"
"
Adquirí dos de estos tenis y ambos ya están rotos. La tela no es resistente. Pésima calidad y el pegamento sobresale de la suela. Horribles.
"
"
The quality is very good, the size matches, all good, the negative comments are simply not true.
"
"
These shoes ripped after 1 month. They’re comfortable but not worth the money to last so short… so annoyed because I thought I was buying a quality shoe. DO NOT BUY!
"
"
After a month and a half, the shoes began to fall apart. Seams busting and eyelets breaking.
"
"
order this shoe for my husband he needed a comfortable tennis shoe to wear it's great
"
"
I have wide feet and I’m 5 weeks into total hip replacement- but these are great for my daily walks!
"
"
This is the worst shoe that Nikes ever made I can’t believe I spent nearly 60 $70 after shipping for the shoe to fall apart in less than 30 days the top of the shoe on the inside of the toe area separated completely from the soul within two weeks of every day casual walking use dog walks to be specific I am a Nike fanatic but I’m very disappointed in the shoe. But it was so bad I no longer I want to buy another pair of Nikes
"
"
Not a good fit and quite flimsy. The tongue is so thin it’s almost impossible to put the shoe on without twisting it. Not what I expected from Nike. The shoe is ok for static use (eliptical, weights etc) but I’d never use them for treadmill nor running. Wouldn’t buy again.
"
"
Excelente, pediré el blanco, ojalá y tenga un buen descuento
"
"
These are very stable shoes.  Good for lateral movement or weight lifting.  In my opinion they are a bit short for the size. Otherwise would be a 5 star rating. They appear exactly as in the description photo.
"
"
Fue mi primer compra y fue genial
"
"
The width is too tight, ordered thesame brand different color size and width is perfect, but this one is the same size but the width is tight.
"
"
The shoes are light weight and provide the support my knees require when doing HIIT workouts.  Highly recommend.
"
"
para personas de pie ancho y empeine alto deberian comprar una talla más
"
"
Might be the widest Nike shoe I have ever worn, perfect for folks that need a wider toe box! The fit is not too tight but not loose at all. 2 weeks of owning and I believe this is the best pair of Nike shoes I have ever owned!

Love this style bought many pairs. However, please be aware it is not true to size. If you’re ordering any pairs that have the fixed rubber backing above the heel, opt for a few sizes up or your going to waste your money or destroy your feet or both. I wear a 10 and an 11 1/2 would be comfortable trust me.

Description states mens shoe but box came stating that it was a womens shoe. I ordered in mens sizing & it came in my proper womens size but if I had known it was a womens shoe I would’ve sized up because womens shoes tend to run narrow for Nike. Had to return due to sizing.
"
"
These fit just the way I expected. I am very pleased with my sneakers!
"
"
I'm on my 5th pair of these shoes, just keep changing colors, best shoes ever... this color blewwww my kind in person

Summer 2020, I bought this sneaker from another retailer for $50! They were on clearance. The shoes look really cool and are soooo comfortable! I swore to myself that I'd NEVER wear them to work... ( I work outdoors primarily) Well, I didn't keep that commitment and the shoes got ruined. Still comfortable but look like crap. So, in March of 2022, I decided to look for another pair.How shocked was I to discover how RARE they are now and how much $$$ sellers are asking for them! At the time, I could only find 4 pairs ($250-500!!!) online. Yeh, I wanted another pair, but that was beyond my pricing principle!In this case, patience won... In May, Amazon algorithm sent me a notification that the shoes I had been searching for were available for $149! Although, still 3x the cost of the original purchase, definitely within my price-zone.With only one pair available, I immediately ordered them! I couldn't wait for their arrival! The day came at last (and a week early)! Excitedly I tore away the shipping bag and opened the box! There they were... The Nike Precision iii onyx/ruby slippers! Haha...I now wear them exclusively when going out on the town and give them a thorough cleaning before returning them to their original box! These kicks get more compliments than my Indiana Jones hat, but that's another story. One VERY happy (repeat) customer!

Needed new basketball shoes for an old man rec league.  These are comfortable and fit true to size.  Traction is just okay but solid value for the price.  Would recommend for an occasional player.
"
"
Very comfortable
"

This is a fantastic but economical sneaker for basketball.  It is light and very responsive.  I feel fast and bouncy when wearing it.  Traction is great.  Sticks to everything and seems durable.  Also very, very comfortable.  Every time I put them on I feel ready to explode on the court.The materials, however, are a bit on the cheap side - especially the upper mesh material.  I have pushed them hard and they have not fallen apart but it is clearly Nike's budget material.  It is also lacking in some support features - mainly lateral lockdown so I would not recommend this for a heavier player or someone who needs a more supportive shoe.  I personally found the support fine for my needs and never had any issues lateral or otherwise but I am on the lighter side.For a lighter, speedy, guard, however,  these are a great budget option that will make you feel great and delivers a fantastic and responsive court feel.
"
"
This shoe fit my son very weirdly. The shoe is long enough, but a little narrow on the width, and the shoe is oddly short in height so the shoe is tight at the top of the the foot. I don’t know if ordering a larger size will help since the shoe is adequate lengthwise, but it’s other dimensions are odd. It was just a weird/odd fit. Too bad because the shoes look very nice.
"
"
This are great shoes! My teenage daughter approves, so that says it all. She wears them for basketball

I tried wearing the shoes around the house.  They rubbed a blister on my ankle, therefore, I returned them.

I only bought these as a new pair of adventure shoes.. now that entails Forests, mountains, deserts, creeks, Rivers and Oceans.. I really put these Nike styles 2 the test... I have had these Nikes now 4 about 2 weeks and I have already climbed Mountains, crossed rivers and traversed waterfalls in Colorado.. I have climbed on cliffs and rock faces in Superior Wisconsin. These shoes preform perfectly every time I climb on rocks and adventure out into the next great thing.. if u want a shoe that's dependable for the price this is it..

After trying Nike's pro visi 6. Yes, I purchased several shoes from the same line, and they no longer make them, i had to find a replacement. So far, they are lighter than what inwould like, but they provide lots of support. Can't wait to run with these.

These are by far the best basketball sneakers for the money.  I love how these lockdown to my ankle and forefoot.  The cushion is also better than expected at this price point.  I actively play twice a week and shoe appears to be holding up really well so far.  Overall a top performer and my current go to!Pros:. Excellent ankle support & containment, great grip, very durable, suitable for indoor and outdoor useCons:. Lack of premium materials, fit is best for normal to narrow foot, limited colorways, not the most stylish in comparison to the market

As I’ve worn Nike since forever, I was certain this pair was previously worn. Both were laced up+ I’ve never had that. I bet these were a return and not fresh.

I purchased it to my husband and he loves the way it looks but it’s hard to put on.

Little snug . Nike runs a little small normally. But these little more so than normal. Size 12
"
"
i love this specific style, these are great and are so comfortable
"
"
Comfortable
"
"
I purchased it to my husband and he loves the way it looks but it’s hard to put on.
"
"
Best pair of sneakers I own and I have lots of Nike Air Max! Very comfortable! Blows the Air 200’s out of the water and I love those shoes too!
"
"
I like the way they are so comfortable and the way they feel bouncy
"
"
Me gustan por eso ordené un número más
"
"
These are my second pair, like walking on air.
"
"
Me agradó el diseño.
"
"
The shoes look great!!!!
"
"
Pretty good shoes but I found that the size 13 ran a bit smaller than usual especially in the front where the large toe resides.
"
"
Absolutely LOVE these shoes!  I searched for weeks to find them in the colors I wanted and then BAMMMM I found these!  ♥️
"
"
After just 20 days of wearing (school starting until now), there is already a hole in this shoe. The whole goes all the way through. Very disappointed, my 11 year old worked to buy these himself and he is very disappointed!!
"
"
I liked the look and functionality. I mostly use in the gym. The seller Ken was gracious to upgrade my shipping so I received them earlier than expected. That was a nice added touch.
"
"
Great shoes i have several colors because the fit is perfect
"
"
I got the pastel version. They seem cool but the 270 logo on one of the shoes is only half there. They seem a little different from other 270s but my girl has them on and she thinks they’re awesome.
"
"
so nice show very worth it love it 👍👍

"
me quedaron bien, muy bonito el diseño

"

Bought them for Disney and had to break them in fist because they are tight at first
"
"
I like the color
"
"
Zapatos cómodos
"
"
on time, size as expected
"
"
These shoes are really narrow. I wear a size 13 and they’re still tight months later. Also the sole is starting to come apart at one area already
"
"
Son muy cómodas las zapatillas Nike, pero lo incómodo fue la talla inexacta.
"
"
The tounge is some type of sponge, they look good also i ordered red lettering ones but i got in black, they arent comfortable also something pokes me on the front of the shoe I think it might tear apart soon, it feels cheap.
"
"
Product was as expected, but one of the charms was missing. Other than that, it was a perfect product.
"
"
The sneakers are classified as men's size and they are not.  VERY SMALL AND I THINK THEY ARE NOT LEGITIMATE

Compra unos Nike Zapatillas de baloncesto para hombre blancas con el lago negro y me llegaron con el logo naranja, adicionalmente no llegaron en caja NIKE, ni tenían etiquetas de NIKE; me queda la duda si en verdad son ORIGINALES NIKE.
"
"
10/10 easy to break in, super comfortable for the gym and lifting, goes with almost every outfit besides obviously formal (but I can even dress these up for a semi-formal type of night out with my girls), and to be frank these were worth every penny.
"
"
Muy bonitos zapatos!! los ordené media talla más y me quedaron perfectos… los recomiendo 💯
"
"
these are lightweight and so comfy. I lift in them and can wear them out and about
"
"
The shoes are cool I just don't like the cotton from the tongue is showing and not stitched up. But true to size. I ordered a size7 and I wear a U.S 7 in women.
"
"
I bought these because i was under the impression the sneakers were in women's sizing.  These are MENS.The sneakers were good quality.
"
"
Bought these for my son. Can’t return them because it is longer than 30 days, however the shoes didn’t even last two month. Super disappointed!
"
"
These are great-looking shoes that throw back to a simpler time for Nike before its massive endorsement deals. The shoes look great but run snug and can take a while to break them in making them a little hard to put on right out of the box. The shoes also have a thin sole which is great from the profile but not for your feet. Size up and buy some replacement insoles.
"
"
Todo perfecto las ame!!!
"
"
Perfect quality and everything. For the people that are confused about the tongue. The tongue that looks like it wasn’t manufactured correctly is actually how it is supposed to look. That is purposely done.

The shoes arrived and the box was crushed pretty bad which is kind of a bummer because you like to keep the Jordan box but the shoes are OK
"
"
These are a perfect fit even with  wide feet.  The size 12 worked great.
"
"
Great show great price and came fast! Very happy with them
"
"
Yes
"
"
Nice
"
"
Such a classy and traditional sneaker for work.
"
"
My son liked the fit and style. He swears he can jump higher in them.
"
"
Purchased for someone, cannot review
"
"
Muy bueno tal como en la foto, totalmente original
"
"
For the many saying they run small, I've found if you break them in and loosen the laces up they fit well. I usually have to buy extra wide.

These are so comfortable and the size was perfect. Very light on your foot and can keep on your foot for a good 24hrs without any feeling of discomfort.  I highly recommend that you also get a pair yourself.  5 star all the way

Everything fix my Husband to a T.

I don't understand the hype with nike shoes. I've bought 3 pairs and they're all uncomfortable. These are no exception. The tounge wraps around in the inside of the shoe and irritates my foot. Can't wear them for more than a few hours before I have to take them off.

Nice looking, but narrow.

My Son really likes them, he is in high school says they fit well and he likes the style. So if hes happy with them so am I
